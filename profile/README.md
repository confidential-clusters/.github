## Welcome to Confidential Clusters

**Confidential Clusters** is a project focused on enabling confidential computing for the entire Kubernetes clusters using Image Based Linux operating systems with [Bootable Containers](https://containers.github.io/bootable/) images. Our mission is to advance the adoption and integration of confidential computing technologies into cloud-native environments.

We aim to build an ecosystem that supports the deployment and management of **Confidential Kubernetes Clusters** using open source tools and standards. This includes enabling components like the Kubernetes control plane, system workloads, and user applications to run with strong hardware-based confidentiality guarantees.

Our focus areas include:

- End-to-end confidential computing for Kubernetes clusters
- Integration with [Trusted Execution Environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment)
- Secure attestation and workload verification
- Open collaboration with other confidential computing projects
